[Mokuton](https://github.com/yudhanjaya/Mokuton) is a simple text editor that I wrote for myself. It's a single html file that creates a modern, one-file word processor with word count tracking and a modern interface. Runs entirely in your browser and uses browser cache to save anything you write, making it very handy for portability and powercuts.

[GalaxyGen](https://github.com/yudhanjaya/GalaxyGen) generates stars, populates them with planets, and even introduces civilizations that can span multiple worlds. The result is visualized in an interface that kind of mimics low-key terminal vibes but also does contain a proper 3D visualization that you can click, drag, and interact with. The underlying structure was originally written for the Salvage Crew novels.

[Colombo: Skylines](https://github.com/team-watchdog/colombo-skylines): an accurate topographical representation of Colombo, built with detailed land use and zoning based on official city development plans and data centered around 2020; over a million virtual citizens, simulating population dynamics that reflect large-scale, real-world demographics and human movement; public transport based on actual route data; and curated visual assets to better match Colombo's unique architectural style.

[geodog](https://github.com/team-watchdog/geodog)is a collection of Python scripts for processing, analyzing, and manipulating images.Useful for various image processing tasks, color analysis, and geographic information systems (GIS) data processing work. [geodog is available as a python library](https://pypi.org/project/geodog/0.1.1/): use pip install geodog

[Antilibrary](https://github.com/team-watchdog/antilibrary) is a primitive Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application that lets you ask questions from your PDFs, epubs, text files and word documents. I'm not working on it any more, since far better RAG applications now exist.

[Pseudowrite](https://github.com/yudhanjaya/pseudowrite) is a tool built as a demo for an Augsberg MFA panel that I was spoke at. It will take a few lines of idea, and, using an iterate-refine loop, will turn it into a coherent act structure and chapter outline. The idea was to show how the likes of ChatGPT 3.5 can actually be a danger if you're a very formulaic writer.
