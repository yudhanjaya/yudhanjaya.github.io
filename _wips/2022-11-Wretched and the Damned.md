>Blurb: a Kafkaesque, near-future Sri Lanka, where superpowers are a lot more common and common sense is still a rarity; about a bunch of rebels trying to overthrow a corrupt, nepotistic, dynastic government; about hopes, dreams, violence, and about the stupidity of it all. Winner of the 2023 Gratiaen Prize.

While some of my short stories have been set in Sri Lanka, I try to avoid expounding on Sri Lanka in my fiction. The excuse I give is that my journalistic work already covers Sri Lanka's multiple crises in painful detail, from economics to mass graves. I have said what I want to say there; for my fiction I prefer to be free to imagine, and let Sri Lanka come with me.

Unfortunately, it seemed I still have some things to say. I've published the [Foreword](/note/2022-11-Foreword-to-Wretched)], which gives more information on how the book came to be. And it turns out that these things were perhaps important enough that the [Gratiaen Trust saw fit to award me a major literary prize for this work](https://www.gratiaen.com/archives/the-30th-gratiaen-prize-report-and-winner-citations). 


As of the time of writing, the Wretched and the Damned is signed for publication with Perera Hussein; it will also come out as an email newsletter, in the original manner in which I first thought to release it.
