Blurb: An AI overseer and a human crew arrive on a distant planet to salvage an ancient UN starship. The overseer is unhappy. The crew, well, they're certainly no A-team. Not even a C-team on the best of days. And worse? Urmagon Beta, the planet, is at the ass-end of nowhere. Everybody expects this to be a long, ugly, and thankless job. Then it all goes disastrously wrong. What they thought was an uninhabited backwater turns out to be anything but empty. Megafauna roam the land, a rival crew with some terrifyingly high-powered gear haunts the dig site, and a secret that will change humanity forever is waiting in the darkness. 

At its heart, the Salvage Crew is dark space adventure with a dash of Wittgenstein and Buddhism in it. It features a depressed, C-team crew, a bored-as-fuck AI poet, an actual alien AI, first contact, giant furry sloths. It's also a love letter to Rimworld and Dwarf Fortress. The audiobook was narrated by Nathan Fillion.

The Salvage Crew was a technical step forward for me in exploring my human+AI thesis; for this book, the voice of the machine poet was an OpenAI GPT-117M model that I retrained on translations of Tang dynasty poetry by the likes of Du Fu and Li Bai, generating thousands of poems that I sifted through, looking for both utility for the story and that ever-so-slight disconnect of style and translation. 

In keeping with the procedural generation scene that I drew inspiration from, the galaxy and the planet were generated by bits of code; and so were the characters and quite a few of the events, including weather. A portion of said galaxy code is available here: https://github.com/yudhanjaya/GalaxyGen. In this I functioned as a sort of rudimentary cyborg, a spider at the heart of a web that would constantly bring me strange things to weave into the story I wanted to tell.

The Salvage Crew became an Audible and Washington Post bestseller, has been recognized by Polygon as one of the best SFF books of 2020, been writted about in detail at Himal SouthAsian, Strange Horizons, the Mithila Review, Religion News and elsewhere. I’ve since explored possible AI+human directions on Slate, Wired, and for Google Research.


The seeds for the Salvage Crew are:

1. OSUN / The Poetry Machine
2. RimWorld and Dwarf Fortress; especially stories that rose from them, like Bogdan’s Rest by Nate Crowley and Boatmurdered.
3. Phet Sayo remarking ‘The Internet is real, but not actual,’ at a conference in Mozambique, and our conversation thereafter, which led me stumbling down the Tractacus
4. The BOLO series, by Keith Laumer and others
5. Peter Watt’s Blindsight, especially the moments where Theseus and Rorshach are in conversation
6. Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, as the Tarkowski version
